## User Story

As a marketing agency
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria


Given a webpage meets accessibility standards
When I view the source code
Then I find semantic HTML elements
When I view the structure of the HTML elements
Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
When I view the icon and image elements
Then I find accessible alt attributes
When I view the heading attributes
Then they fall in sequential order
When I view the title element
Then I find a concise, descriptive title

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the webpage's appearance and functionality: (../UPENN-VIRT-FSF-FT-07-2022-U-LOLC/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

## Description

In the starter code, we were given a html file that had little to no semantic elements. My task was to “clean up” the code as much as possible to make the code easier to maintain and debug down the line. Also, semantic elements help with accessibility and readability. I learned how having semantic elements help developers who aren’t building projects from scratch, helps them quickly understand what they are looking at. If you would have a bunch of div’s in a file that had thousands of lines of code, it would be very confusing/frustrating trying to debug the file.
